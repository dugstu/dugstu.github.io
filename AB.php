        <h3>Authority Brands</h3>
        <p>Authority Brands is the second largest franchisor of home repair brands in the US. They have a portfolio of companies that cover HVAC, plumbing, electrical work, and more. If you need work done on your home, chances are good that you've hired an Authority Brands franchise.</p>
        <p>Authority owns a software suite called Successware. It was responsible for every aspect of franchise business: accounting, reporting, dispatch, technician management, sales, inventory management, etc. Their system was old and missing numerous capabilities that come with modern web-based technologies. They engaged with Thoughtworks to update this software suite.</p>
        <p>We decided that a good starting place was a mobile app for field technicians to interface with their home offices.</p>
        <h4>PEOPLE | GOALS | CONSTRAINTS</h4>
        <p>I oversaw a team of four designers, three product analysts, a dozen developers, and two QAs. Most of the team was located in China, with a pair of designers in the US responsible for usability testing. Our primary goal was the construction of a mobile app for phones and tablets that would allow technicians to receive jobs, take notes on those jobs, and change the status of those jobs. Addtionally, technicians would be able to provide product and service purchase options to customers directly from the app. This necessitated an app that would be "front-facing." This meant something that would provide technicians with the maximum amount of information necessary to quickly understand a job, while also providing customer-facing pages that were clear, easy to understand, and appealling.</p>
        <p>For the most part, this was a fairly straightforward project. Initially our only constraints were reasonable time and budget limits. However, late in the project we came across a hurdle. (See below.)</p>
        <h4>PROCESS</h4>
        <p>The process here consisted of three major parts.</p>

                <img src="../img/ab/van.png" alt="On-site Research">

            <div class="lightbox" id="van">
                <a href="#_" class="btn-close">&times;</a>
                    <img src="../img/ab/van.png">
            </div>
        </figure>
        <h5>ONSITE RESEARCH</h5>
        <p>To better understand the technicians, their customers (namely homeowners), franchise owners, and the home services business in general, our design and product team headed out on a summer-long road trip.  We visited businesses all over the United States who used Successware as well as the product's main competitors. We spent time working alongside the technicians, while they were on-site, to better understand how they worked. The learnings we gathered from this greatly informed and drove our roadmap.</p>

                <img src="../img/ab/inception.png" alt="Inception">
            </a>
            <div class="lightbox" id="inception">
                <a href="#_" class="btn-close">&times;</a>
                    <img src="../img/ab/inception.png">
            </div>
        </figure>
        <h5>INCEPTION</h5>
        <p>After that initial research, we conducted our inception, joined by our full team who traveled from China, spending time with the client in Maryland and New York. For two weeks, with about 30 people in the room, we defined the project context, vision, users, key stakeholders, as-is workflow, pain points, to-be journey, technical stack, and legacy software considerations.</p>
        <p>This appears to be really expensive work to get this many high salaries together for many days, but it pays off when you've clarified goals, set direction, and cleared up assumptions on an organizational scale.</p>

                    <img src="../img/ab/tripletrack.png">
            </div>
        </figure>
        <h5>DELIVERY</h5>
        <p>From there we moved into delivery and quickly started building software. We ran a triple-track agile model where we were doing discovery, delivery, and usability testing all running in parallel.
        We also ended up providing a fair amount of executive advisory and marketing support throughout our sprints &mdash; helping Authority Brands tell the story of why they invested in Successware's transformation, and also guiding them toward future innovation.</p>
        <h4>SIDEBAR: A HITCH</h4>
        <p>With just six weeks left in the development of our first major release, Successware's largest competitor bought the 3rd-party mobile application provider our client depended upon and aggressively pursued Successware's customers to convert. We partnered with our client to quickly evaluate the landscape and recommended adjusting their short and medium-term product roadmap, both in feature delivery and timeline.</p>
        <p>This shift entailed focusing on particular parts of the technician's job that couldn't be done by the offices, and also laid the groundwork for future functionality. Just enough to give customers confidence that they would be able to continue business, and could see how new features would improve their capabilities and work efficiency as time went on.</p>
        <p>Our team worked round the clock to make this new product strategy happen in time. With the mobile app's delivery success, our account grew into transforming the whole Successware Platform which is still in development today.</p>

        <h4>RESULTS</h4>
        <p>This was a successful endeavor. After we released version 1, market share went up and Authority Brands has been able to retire their third-party application, saving hefty licensing fees, and ensuring that their customers wouldn't be forced to move to Authority's competitors. Additionally, this success led to TW expanding our relationship with Authority to be responsible for transforming their entire platform. Finally, we're releasing new versions on a monthly cadence. For a client like Authority, where they were used to releasing once every 5-7 years, this is a significant improvement.</p>
