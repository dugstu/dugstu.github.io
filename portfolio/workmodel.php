        <h2>A model for cultivating good work</h2>
        <p>In addition to my work with clients, I have been a leader within the product and design practices at Thoughtworks. From my time working with designers of all stripes &mdash; people from all over the world, new and long-experienced, people who came straight out of a D-school vs people for whom design is a second or even third career &mdash; I have built out a model of how designers work, and how to improve their lives to get the best work possible out of them.</p>
        <p>The model looks like this.</p>
        <figure>
            <a href="#model-craft" class="thumb">
                <img src="../img/portfolio/model-craft.png" alt="Work Model - Craft">
            </a>
            <div class="lightbox" id="model-craft">
                <a href="#_" class="btn-close">&times;</a>
                    <img src="../img/portfolio/model-craft.png">
            </div>
        </figure>
        <p>The first layer is craft. That's all about doing the work: it's the tools and techniques that you use day-in day-out. In the case of product design, this is what allows you to do research, interaction design, visual design. Being able to practice your craft makes you a designer. Every designer coming to into a practice has to be able to show their craft before getting hired, and every designer should continue to hone their skills over time.</p>

            <a href="#model-community" class="thumb">
                <img src="../img/portfolio/model-community.png" alt="Work Model - Community">
            </a>
            <div class="lightbox" id="model-community">
                <a href="#_" class="btn-close">&times;</a>
                    <img src="../img/portfolio/model-community.png">
            </div>
        </figure>
        <p>Next is community. This is all about discussing the work. This requires other people in your field with whom you can discuss problems you're having, feedback on your work, career paths, ideas on how to improve any area of your job. If craft is what is required to be a designer, community is how you become a good designer: when you're able to get input from people with similar experiences, and who you can trust to have a body of knowledge that makes them worth hearing, you're not working in a vacuum.</p>
        <figure>
            <a href="#model-capability" class="thumb">
                <img src="../img/portfolio/model-capability.png" alt="Work Model - Capability">
            </a>
            <div class="lightbox" id="model-capability">
                <a href="#_" class="btn-close">&times;</a>
                    <img src="../img/portfolio/model-capability.png">
            </div>
        </figure>
        <p>Finally there's capability. This is how you can be a successful designer: by having impact. This is where knowledge peeks over into wisdom, seeing the forest for the trees. These are the efforts we make to ensure that our work sees the light of day, and is useful and usable, and solves the right problems for our clients and the right problems for their customers.</p>
        <p>I've been a strong advocate here for using the methodologies of design not only for products, but for ways of working, our relationships with our clients. Design at Thoughtworks didn't used to be considered a capability, but that has changed, and I'm proud of that.</p>

                <img src="../img/portfolio/workinggroups.png" alt="Working Groups">
            </a>
            <div class="lightbox" id="workinggroups">
                <a href="#_" class="btn-close">&times;</a>
                    <img src="../img/portfolio/workinggroups.png">
            </div>
        </figure>
        <p>A few years ago I started putting this model into practice, using a lot of the techniques mentioned above, and determined where the pain points are in the designers' journeys: both within client projects, but also their overall careers. That led to the formation and oversight of a number of working groups within the design practice. I'm a firm believer that improvement comes from within, so one of the things that I implemented was getting every designer we have involved in at least one of these working groups. We've focused energies on hiring, career paths, tool sets, improving evangelization of our work, and more.</p>

            </a>
            <div class="lightbox" id="workinggroups2">
                <a href="#_" class="btn-close">&times;</a>
                    <img src="../img/portfolio/workinggroups2.png">
            </div>
        </figure>
        <p>This is the kind of work that often gets sidelined because it requires effort but it's harder to draw a bright line to the payoff. It's not client work, so it's hard to see where the profit is. But it's there, because it improves the capabilities of individual designers, and when you scale that you get exponential improvements. And that's a win-win situation.</p>
