        <h3>NCLH</h3>
        <p><p>Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings is the third-largest cruise operator in the world. It operates three separate cruise lines, with different price points and clientele. During the pandemic, all of their cruise ships were shut down; they wisely determined that was an optimal time to update their digital presence.</p>
        <p>In autumn of 2020, they engaged with Thoughtworks to build a mobile app to be used by guests onboard their cruises. Thoughtworks convinced them that it would be a better use of resources to consider the totality of the guest experience, not only the time onboard. (We expected that, if the experience onboard was good enough, it would mean people spending less time staring at their phones.) They agreed, and we built an engagement to design a superior guest experience.</p>

        <h4>PEOPLE | GOALS | CONSTRAINTS</h4>
        <p> I oversaw a team of three designers, two product analysts, two technical analysts, and a subject matter expert. We had eight weeks to define a customer experience vision and a strategic direction for potential innovation. To do this we would map out current and future CX experiences. Within those maps we would highlight touchpoints and their related business outcomes.</p>
        <p>There were a couple of unusual constraints, primarily around not being able to work in-person with anyone due to the pandemic. Historically, we like to work directly with people. Further, normally we would want to tour the physical spaces where we would expect potential tools would be used. In this case, that would be the ships and the ports. The pandemic made this impossible. Instead we had to use photos, plans, found videos of the spaces.</p>
        <p>Additionally, cruise experiences are a combination of a number of different domains: transportation, security, retail, casinos, dining, leisure, hotels, cruise ships have everything these days. (One of their ships has an outboard go-kart track on the top of it!)</p>
        <p>As a result, we had to be particularly intentional with our work to ensure we considered all of these various elements, while simultaneously avoided spending too much time going down rabbit holes.</p>

        <h4>PROCESS</h4>
        <p>The process included six parts, from mapping NCL's current state to potential destinations for their CX experience.</p>

        </figure>
        <h5>RESEARCH</h5>
        <p>Research went in two directions: competitive research and internal interviews. We looked at what NCL offered, as well as how they fared in the competitive landscape. We considered reviews, youtube videos of various cruises, online travel forums. We reserved cruises (as best we could) on competitors’ lines. </p>
        <p>We also interviewed a number of NCL employees, around 70 people in total. This included VPs of various domains (hotel, dining, etc.), ship captains, heads of housekeeping, cruise directors, head of security. It’s always a good idea to get a sense of how things work from people all up and down the chain. Additionally you gain a lot of experience in a short time by talking with long-time employees.</p>

            </div>
        </figure>
        <h5>GUEST INTERVIEWS</h5>
        <p>While talking with NCL employees, we also interviewed around 40 guests. This included people who had been on Norwegian cruises as well as a number who had been on competitors’ lines. These interviews allowed us to understand their opinions about motivations for cruising, as well as favorite activities both on the ship and in the ports. Plus, we were able to understand how they felt during every step of their first and last days of their cruise.</p>
        <p>This work started to pay off immediately. Early on we were able to dispel some assumptions on the part of our client. For instance, there was an opinion on the part of many NCL employees that the first day of a cruise is the worst: there are a lot of lines inside ugly warehouses with fluorescent lights. Security takes a long time. Everyone is required to muster once they’re on the ship, to learn safety protocols, it’s unclear when guests will get their luggage, and on and on.</p>
        <p>However, after we started talking with guests, we found that there were very few complaints about this. Certainly, this part of the experience provides opportunities for improvement, but from the guests’ perspective, this isn’t a big deal, mostly because of the excitement of the beginning of the trip. You're near this massive ship, larger than you can imagine, and you’re slowly getting closer to boarding. It creates anticipation. And once you’re onboard, there are so many things to see and do, and the excitement of the upcoming ports. It turns out that there’s so much excitement that it mutes the pain of most serious hassles on the first day.</p>
        <p>But the last day? TONS of guest complaints about that one. For one thing, your trip is coming to an end. You have to face the inevitable fact that you are going to have to go back to the real world, your lousy job, whatever problems you normally face. Additionally, you get hit with a bill that is almost always considerably larger than you expected. And finally, once the ship docks, the crew doesn’t hesitate to get guests off swiftly, because they have to clean and prep the entire ship to take on another batch of guests that same day. So there were a lot of opportunities there.</p>
        <p>We took standardized sets of notes for each guest and looked for patterns. This data fed the next steps.</p>

        </figure>
        <h5>ARCHETYPES</h5>
        <p>We discovered patterns around how people cruise, their motivations and goals. The overall distinctions focused on whether the guest was primarily on the cruise for the port destinations, the people with whom they would interact, or the experience of being on the open sea.</p>
        <p>From there we were able to slot each person into an archetype and then map out what was important in each of those areas. There were some nice revelations around how those three points of interest interacted with each other.</p>

        <h5>JOURNEY MAPS</h5>
        <p>These archetypes were a primary driver in our guest journey maps. Using all of the research we had done, we were able to map out the entire guest experience, from the time when a potential guest was thinking about going on a holiday, to considering a cruise, to shopping various cruise options, and then all of the events on the cruise itself: ports, dining, onboard events, gambling, etc. all the way to completing the cruise, sharing pictures and stories with friends and family, to six months later when perhaps it’s time to plan for the next cruise. <a href="../img/ncl/NCLGuestJourneyMap.pdf" target="_blank">(pdf)</a></p>

        <p>And inside of these maps there are mini-stories of potential issues that might warrant solutions. This one shows a current situation where guests don’t reserve dining plans ahead of time. The resulting experience is a general pain with numerous opportunities for improvement.

        <h5>IDEATION</h5>
        <p>From those maps, we are able to highlight pain points and ideas for how to improve particular interactions, but we’re also synthesizing ideas into a more cohesive overall experience. We went through a number of exercises to think about a different, holistic way to approach guest experiences.</p>
        <p>And from those exercises we came up with a number of different ideas that we were able to put into various story forms, including some very early prototypes.</p>

            </div>
        </figure>
        <h5>VALUE CANVAS</h5>
        <p>We took all of these ideas, packaged them as stories, and ran them by leaders from several parts of the organization. We ran some workshops to determine the value of each idea from the perspective of the guest experience, the business value, and the technical complexity. Ideas that had high CX value, provided the potential for a big lift to the business, and were simpler technically, got prioritized as things to try first.</p>

                    <img src="../img/ncl/featuremap.png">
            </div>
        </figure>
        <p>From there we were able to build a plan for digital products and tools to make this happen, to treat all of these ideas holistically. This was particularly important: one of the primary messages we stressed was that the guest experience was the totality of the thing: we couldn’t consider these products separately just yet. We had to understand how they would all work in concert.</p>

        <h4>RESULTS</h4>
        <p>This process was a success. We were able to take much of NCL's leadership on the journey of not only what to do, but how we got there, together. They had all played a part in figuring this out, and they could demonstrate each of the steps we took to create the plan. So we were able to cut down on the noise, on the decisions made by HIPPOs without any justification, and that made it easier for everyone to understand the vision and get onboard. Our contacts at NCL were able to take this plan to their leaders and begin steps to implement this plan.</p>
        <p>This work led directly to multiple multi-month projects engaging three dozen consultants on three different continents working over the past eighteen months. Our work with NCL continues to thrive, and is one of our largest customer experience success stories.</p>
