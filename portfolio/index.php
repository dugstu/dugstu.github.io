            <p>In the cases when I do have to introduce this framework, I generally simplify it to the above. This helps ground projects by focusing on a single diamond at any given time.</p>

            <h4>Norwegian Cruise Lines</h4>
            <p>Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings is the third-largest cruise operator in the world. It operates three separate cruise lines, with different price points and clientele. During the pandemic, all of their cruise ships were shut down; they wisely determined that was an optimal time to update their digital presence.</p>
            <p>In autumn of 2020, they engaged with Thoughtworks to build a mobile app to be used by guests onboard their cruises. Thoughtworks convinced them that it would be a better use of resources to consider the totality of the guest experience, not only the time onboard. <a href="NCLH.php">(more)</a></p>

            <h4>Authority Brands</h4>
            <p>Authority Brands is the second largest franchisor of home repair brands in the US. They have a portfolio of companies that cover HVAC, plumbing, electrical work, and more. If you need work done on your home, chances are good that you've hired an Authority Brands franchise.</p>
            <p>AB's old software system was old and missing numerous capabilities that come with modern web-based technologies. They engaged with Thoughtworks to update this software suite. We decided to start with a mobile app for field technicians to interface with their home offices. <a href="AB.php">(more)</a></p>

                <p></p>From my time working with designers of all stripes&mdash;people from all over the world, new and long-experienced, people who came straight out of a D-school vs people for whom design is a second or even third career&mdash;I have built out a model of how designers work and how to improve their working lives to get the best work possible out of them. <a href="workmodel.php">(more)</a></p>

                <h4>Wheels Up</h4>
                <p>Wheels Up is a private aircraft charter company that provides flights for customers who are accustomed to a level of service unavailable from most large airlines. They asked for a proposal for a new client experience that better suited their brand.</p>
                <p>In addition to recommendations around how to enhance customer experience outside of the transactions around the flight itself, I helped design a prototype to provide some ideas around that new visual experience. <a href="wheelsup.php">(more)</a></p>
